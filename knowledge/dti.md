# Digital Technology Immersion (DTI)

## Cross-College Industry Innovation
Students may fulfill their MPS project requirement through the Digital Technology Immersion (DTI) program, a collaboration between Cornell’s Business School and the Information Science department. DTI provides a business-focused alternative to the traditional MPS project.

## DTI Course
In DTI, students work alongside MBA peers on:
- Client-based projects with leading technology companies, or  
- Executive-mentored case studies  

The program blends hands-on project work with industry mentorship and weekly discussions on technology management.

Students interested in completing DTI in place of the MPS Project must submit their information through the designated survey by **November 2**. If selected by the Business School, the Johnson School Registrar will enroll the student in **NBA 6480: Digital Technology Practicum**.

## Recommended Electives
Students participating in DTI are encouraged—though not required—to take **3 to 6 credits** of NBA courses from the approved DTI elective list. These electives:
- May be taken in either the fall or spring semester  
- Do not need to be taken concurrently with the DTI course  
- Are typically offered as 1.5-credit courses during either half of the semester  

Enrollment depends on seat availability. If a course is over-enrolled, normal waitlist procedures apply.
