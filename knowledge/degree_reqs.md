# Academic Planning: MPS in Information Science

A customizable program shaped by your interests.  
The Master of Professional Studies (MPS) in Information Science offers a distinctive curriculum structure with no required core courses, allowing students to design a personalized course of study that aligns with their professional goals.

While students have flexibility in course selection, the program offers four focus areas to guide those seeking specialized expertise in specific domains within Information Science.

## Planning Your Curriculum

### A Flexible Course Structure
The MPS curriculum prepares students for industry success by combining essential foundations with advanced technical skills, culminating in a real-world project developed in partnership with leading companies.

To complete the MPS degree in Information Science, students must complete **at least 30 credits** of 5000-level or higher courses, taking **no more than 19 credits per semester**.

Beginning **Fall 2026**, a new three-semester track will require **a minimum of 39 total credits**.

## Information Systems (IS) Courses
Students must complete **a minimum of 9 credits** of Information Systems courses, which focus on developing technical skills required to design, develop, and analyze socio-computational systems.

## Human and Social Systems (HSS) Courses
Students must complete **a minimum of 9 credits** of Human and Social Systems courses, which examine how the human world intersects with computing systems and digital technology, including cognitive, behavioral, social, organizational, economic, legal, and societal aspects.

## The MPS Project (INFO 5900)
All MPS students must complete the **MPS Project (INFO 5900, 3 credits)**.  
Projects are completed in teams of 5–7 students, offered in fall or spring, giving students an opportunity to practice collaboration and work with a real client.

## Professional Career Development (INFO 5905)
All MPS students must complete **INFO 5905 (0.5 credits, S/U)**.

Early Credit students must take this during their second semester.

Students **may waive** this requirement if they already have a job offer or guaranteed post-graduation employment. To request a waiver, email **Rebecca Salk (rebecca.salk@cornell.edu)** prior to the start of the semester. The waiver approval should be attached to the student’s degree checklist.

## Elective Courses
Any remaining credits needed to reach the 30-credit requirement may be fulfilled with elective courses. Electives allow students to complement and extend their Information Science training.

Pre-approved electives include:

- Courses listed on the MPS course spreadsheet  
- **All INFO/CS/STSCI courses at the 5000-level or higher** that are not categorized as IS or HSS  
- **INFO 7900 (Independent Research)**, pending faculty approval

### Elective Approval Process
To request approval for an elective that is not pre-approved, email the Director of the MPS program, **Gilly Leshed**, with:
- Course ID  
- Course title  
- Course description (from the Class Roster)  
- A brief justification explaining its relevance to the MPS degree  

## Grade Requirements
- **Information Science and Elective Courses:** Minimum grade **C**  
  - Up to **2 credits** may be taken S/U, including INFO 5905  
- **MPS Project:** Minimum grade **B**  
- **Minimum cumulative GPA:** **2.5**

## Optional Focus Areas
Choosing a focus area is optional and is intended only to guide course selection.

The four focus areas are:

- **Data Science**  
- **Interactive Technologies**  
- **User Experience**  
- **Networks, Crowds, and Markets**
