2. **Information Systems (IS)** – _minimum 9 credits_  
   - Courses focusing on technical, computational, and infrastructural aspects of information systems and technologies.  

### 3.3 MPS Project

All students must satisfy the **MPS Project** requirement via one of the following:

1. **MPS Project Course (standard route)**  
   - Semester-long, client-based project.  
   - Students typically work in teams of about **5–7** members.  
   - Emphasis on:
     - Scoping and managing a real client engagement  
     - Delivering on-time, high-quality results  
     - Practicing team collaboration, communication, and project management  

2. **Digital Technology Immersion (NBA 6480, Spring only, limited seats)**  
   - Offered through the Johnson Graduate School of Management.  
   - Students may use this immersion course to fulfill the MPS Project requirement, subject to availability and program rules.

### 3.4 Professional Career Development

- Students must complete **INFO 5905: Professional Career Development**  
  - 0.5 credits  
  - Graded S/U (pass/fail)  
  - Typically taken during the MPS year (Early Credit students complete it in their second semester in the program).  

### 3.5 Electives

After meeting the Information Science + MPS Project + INFO 5905 requirements, the remaining credits (to reach 30) can be taken as **electives**:

- Electives can be additional INFO courses or pre-approved courses from other departments.  
- The aim is to build depth in the chosen focus area(s) and fill skill gaps relevant to career goals.  

### 3.6 Grade & GPA Requirements

- **INFO & elective courses:** minimum grade of **C**  
- **MPS Project:** minimum grade of **B**  
- **Minimum cumulative GPA:** **2.5**  
- Up to **2 credits** may be taken S/U (pass/fail), including INFO 5905.

## 4. Optional Focus Areas

Students are not required to declare a focus, but the program provides **four optional focus areas** to help structure course choices. Each combines both HSS and IS perspectives.

### 4.1 Data Science

Focus: using data to drive insight and decision-making.

Students in this area typically:

- Learn to apply data mining, machine learning, and statistical techniques.  
- Work with large datasets from multiple sources.  
- Practice building analysis pipelines: data collection, cleaning, modeling, and communication.  

### 4.2 Interactive Technologies

Focus: building interactive systems and tools.

Students in this area typically:

- Develop skills in **prototyping, front-end development, and interactive system design**.  
- Build applications that may include web, mobile, hardware, or mixed reality components.  
- Work on domains like health, education, and business.  

### 4.3 User Experience (UX)

Focus: human-centered design of technology products and services.

Students in this area typically:

- Combine **user research methods** (interviews, usability testing, fieldwork) with UX design.  
- Learn how to design interaction flows, information architecture, and visual interfaces.  
- Consider broader social impact and ethical implications of technology.  

### 4.4 Networks, Crowds, and Markets

Focus: online platforms, marketplaces, and social systems.

Students in this area typically:

- Study **online networks**, human behavior in large-scale systems, and market mechanisms.  
- Apply tools from **economics, sociology, computer science, mathematics, ethics, and law**.  
- Analyze and design networked platforms (social networks, marketplaces, crowdsourcing systems, etc.).
