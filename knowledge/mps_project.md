# The MPS Project

## Gain Real-World Project Experience
As part of the MPS program, students complete a semester-long project in either the fall or spring semester. This required project gives students the opportunity to work with a real client, deliver work on time, and meet professional expectations. Projects are completed in teams of 5–7 students, allowing students to practice collaboration, work distribution, and team communication.

Projects typically include social or behavioral components, technological components, or both. Common project areas include user experience, natural language processing, information policy, data science and analytics, machine learning, network analysis, mobile technologies, and design.

## Bidding and Selection
During the first week of the semester, students receive a document outlining the available MPS projects. Students bid on these projects by listing their preferences and relevant skills.

The MPS project instructor matches students to projects based on:
- Student preferences  
- Student skills  
- Project requirements  

Students and clients are notified of the project assignments after the first week of the semester.

At the start of the project, students and the client agree on intellectual property (IP) ownership. IP may be designated as client-owned, student-owned, or placed in the public domain. Students may consult University Counsel or the Cornell Center for Technology Licensing. Students will sign NDAs when required.

## Client Engagement
Each project has a designated client representative who serves as the primary point of contact for the student team and the MPS project instructor. Students are expected to communicate with the representative weekly—via email, Zoom, phone, or other means—to share updates, discuss progress, and identify challenges.

The client representative provides mentorship, guidance, and feedback throughout the semester and may attend the semester-end poster session.

## Progress and Deliverables
Throughout the semester, students must provide the client with the following deliverables:

### Project Proposal (Week 4)
Students present a plan for how they will address the project challenge. Typical components include:
- Project goal  
- Work plan  
- Feasibility testing  
- Competitor review  
- Timeline  
- Division of labor  

### Progress Report (Week 8)
Students present what they have accomplished so far. Expectations for this milestone are defined by the client representative.

### Final Report (Week 14)
The final report and presentation summarize the entire project, including background, methods, results, and final outcomes. Students also provide a handover package to the client representative.

## Evaluation
The goal of the MPS project is to provide students with experience addressing real-world challenges in collaboration with organizations within and beyond Cornell.

At the end of the semester, the faculty advisor assigns grades based on:
- Quality of project deliverables (proposal, progress report, final report)  
- Self and peer evaluations completed by students  
- Client representative’s assessment of the project process and outcomes
